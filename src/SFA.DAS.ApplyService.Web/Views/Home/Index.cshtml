            <p class="govuk-body">
                Use this service to join the register of apprenticeship training providers (RoATP) so you can train apprentices in England.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We'll guide you through the application and you can ask for help on each page. You do not have to complete your application in one go, you can save your details and finish it later.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will use information:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>in the public domain to support the assessment of application answers</li>
                <li>they already have on your organisation to support the assessment of application questions</li>
                <li>from your application to verify the people in control of your organisation. This is defined in the Persons with Significant Control Regs 2016</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before you make an application, you should understand that your organisation:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>must develop and deliver a quality apprenticeship as described by <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/quality/what-is-a-quality-apprenticeship" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (opens in new tab)</a></li>
                <li>will not join the RoATP until it completes all post application tasks - we'll tell you more about this in the application (not for supporting providers)</li>
                <li>must agree to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conditions-of-acceptance-for-apprenticeship-training-providers" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">conditions of acceptance for the RoATP (opens in new tab)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                You'll need to allow approximately 12 weeks for them to assess your application. This may take longer during busy times.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once your organisation is on the RoATP, it will be:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>listed on <a href="https://download.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">the register of apprenticeship training providers (opens in new tab)</a></li>
                <li>eligible to receive government funding to train apprentices</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Being on the RoATP does not mean your organisation is recommended by ESFA. It cannot use ESFA as a 'kite-mark' or an award and will not have an identification number for the RoATP.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Your organisation can only apply once in a 12-month period.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you're a registered company, you should check that Companies House has the correct information for your company directors and people with significant control.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you're a registered charity, you should check that The Charity Commission has the correct information for your trustees and people with significant control.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Provider route</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You will need to choose your organisation's provider route.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Main provider</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Your organisation will directly deliver training to apprentices for other organisations.
                While doing this, it can also train:

            <p class="govuk-body">
