            <p class="govuk-body">
                Use this service to join the register of apprenticeship training providers (RoATP) so that you can train apprentices in England.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We'll guide you through the application and you can ask for help on each page. You do not have to complete your application in one go, you can save your details and finish it later.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will use information:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>in the public domain to support the assessment of application answers</li>
                <li>they already have on your organisation to support the assessment of application questions</li>
                <li>from your application to verify the people in control of your organisation. This is defined in the Persons with Significant Control Regs 2016</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before you make an application, you should understand that your organisation:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>must develop and deliver apprenticeship training in line with <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/quality/what-is-a-quality-apprenticeship/" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education’s ‘quality statement’ (opens in a new window or tab)</a></li>
                <li>will not join the RoATP until it completes all post application tasks - we'll tell you more about this in the application (not for supporting providers)</li>
                <li>must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conditions-of-acceptance-for-apprenticeship-training-providers" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">conditions of acceptance for the RoATP (opens in a new window or tab)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                You'll need to allow approximately 12 weeks for them to assess your application. This may take longer during busy times.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once your organisation on the RoATP, it will be:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>listed on the <a href="https://download.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">register of apprenticeship training providers (opens in a new window or tab)</a></li>
                <li>eligible to receive government funding to train apprentices</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Being on the RoATP does not mean your organisation is recommended by ESFA. It cannot use ESFA as a 'kite-mark' or an award and will not have an identification number for the RoATP.
