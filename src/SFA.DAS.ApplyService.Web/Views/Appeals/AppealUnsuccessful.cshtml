                If you are currently on the register, the ESFA will write to you to advise what actions they will take, as explained in the <a href="@ExternalLinks.RemovalConsequences" target="_blank" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consequences section</a> of the new policy.

                You may be able to re-apply after a 12-month period from your application submitted date, but this will depend on the RoATP market entry conditions at that time.
